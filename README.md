# üß† NYPD Arrest Data Analysis ‚Äì AI Classification Project

## üìò Overview

This project uses machine learning classification techniques to analyze and predict criminal patterns from the [NYPD Arrest Data (YTD)]([https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u/about_data)). The aim is to uncover insights into crime demographics, trends, and categories that can support data-driven decision-making regarding urban safety.

## üîç Problem Statement

Safety is a critical concern when selecting a place to live, study, or work. Social perceptions of crime are often unreliable. This project provides a data-driven method to assess regional crime severity using arrest records, enabling more informed decisions.

---

## üéØ Project Motivation

Crimes occur unpredictably and are increasingly enabled by technological means. Understanding patterns through AI can help anticipate and address emerging risks across different boroughs and demographics.

| Category                 | Features |
|--------------------------|----------|
| **Crime Description**    | `PD_CD`, `PD_DESC`, `KY_CD`, `OFNS_DESC`, `LAW_CODE`, `LAW_CAT_CD` |
| **Location Details**     | `ARREST_BORO`, `ARREST_PRECINCT`, `JURISDICTION_CODE` |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### üîß Data Preprocessing

- Dropped rows with missing values in key target columns (`LAW_CAT_CD`, etc.)
- Removed irrelevant features (`ARREST_KEY`, `PD_CD`, `KY_CD`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, etc.)
- Simplified high-cardinality columns (e.g., grouped offense types in `OFNS_DESC`)
- Converted `ARREST_DATE` into:
  - Day of the week
  - Month
  - Time-of-day categories

These steps reduced dimensionality and improved model efficiency and interpretability.

### üìà Model Targets

- `AGE_GROUP`
- `PERP_SEX`
- `PERP_RACE`
- `LAW_CAT_CD`

## üß† Algorithms Applied

| Algorithm           | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Naive Bayes**     | Assumes independence between features; simple and fast |
| **Decision Tree (J48)** | Rule-based classification using hierarchical splits |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Optimal margin classifier using linear or kernel-based transformations |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Instance-based learning using neighborhood voting |
| **Neural Networks (ANN)** | Multi-layer perceptrons with activation functions |
| **Logistic Regression** | Linear classification using sigmoid function |
